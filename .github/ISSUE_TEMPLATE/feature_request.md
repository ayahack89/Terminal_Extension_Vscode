**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
If there's something in your workflow that feels clunky, repetitive, or could be smoother with Termino, let me know! I'm always curious to hear how people use terminal shortcuts and where things could improve.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Got a cool idea in mind? Maybe a small tweak or a whole new way to make terminal life easier? Share it here no suggestion is too small.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
If you've seen a similar feature elsewhere or thought of different approaches, feel free to drop that info too. It helps shape better decisions.

**Additional context**
Any screenshots, mockups, or random thoughts you want to toss in, go for it. Everything helps.

Letâ€™s build something awesome, together.
